# Quiz Bowl Entity Resolution

This is a project I did in grad school to try to use entity resolution techniques to identify answers to quiz bowl questions. I dusted it off after a long time away, and surprisingly to me, the code still runs, so I figured it was worth preserving. I do not expect it will be useful or interesting to anyone but myself, but would be happy to be proven wrong.

I'm not sure why the tests directory is named `oldtests` but I suspect that means that in my haste to get things done they were not kept up to date (They don't seem to run, which lends support to this theory).

Unfortunately, the database with all the question and answer data is more than 100 MB, so I can't store it on Github.
